Octoprint + Flashforge Creator Pro + Cura


This is a repository to hold work related to getting the Flashforge Creator Pro 3d printer to work with Cura via Octoprint and the GPX plugin.  There are various directions and notes around the internet of various ages and conflicting advice. None of them were clear and error-free.  The goal of this repository is to collect and document, with the community, the best practices for getting the FFCP to work with Cura and Octoprint.
